# Sentiment Analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify textual data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. 

## Overview

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at understanding and categorizing subjective information expressed in text. CNNs, originally designed for image recognition, have been adapted for text classification tasks, including sentiment analysis.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Tejesh1606/Sentiment_Analysis.git


2. Download the data zip file from [here](link_to_your_data.zip) and extract it into the project directory.

3. Run the `sentiment_analysis_cnn.py` script:

python sentiment_analysis.ipynb


4. Follow the prompts to train the CNN model and perform sentiment analysis on input text.
